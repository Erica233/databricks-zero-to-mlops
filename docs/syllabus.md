# MLOps from Zero with Databricks

## Logistics

* Six-Hour Weekly Sessions
* Use [Azure Open Datasets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/open-datasets/dataset-catalog#AzureDatabricks)

## Week by Week Schedule

### Week One:  Getting Started with Spark for MLOPs

#### Topics

* Topic:  Getting Started with Databricks and Spark
* Topic:  Getting Started with Continuous Integration

#### Learning Objectives

*   Compose Continuous Integration solutions
*   Compose Databricks/Spark Cluster Solutions

#### Readings/Media

* [Quickstart Azure Databricks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/scenarios/quickstart-create-databricks-workspace-portal?tabs=azure-portal)

#### Lab

* [Github Actions pytest](https://github.com/noahgift/github-actions-pytest)

#### Discussions

* Why is CI (Continuous Integration) a foundational component for MLOps?
* Why is logging, monitoring and instrumentation so critical with distributed systems like Spark?

#### Assignments

* Build out your own Github repository with a Python scaffold of:  `Makefile`, `requirements.txt`, a source file, and a test file and do:  `make lint && make test && make format`.
* Add a Jupyter Notebook to your Continuous Integration setup and test it with `pytest --nbval`. [nbval plugin reference](https://github.com/computationalmodelling/nbval). 
* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis with a Databricks Spark Cluster using the [Azure Open Datasets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/open-datasets/dataset-catalog).
